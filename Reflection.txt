# Third note on 7/1/21, yes! I can make changes in both directions!!

# Second note from 7/1/21, I managed to get changes on the ZJE server onto GitHub but can I make changes on the website and send them back?

# Note from 7/1/21, I have cloned this repo onto the ZJE server and am now going to attempt to push it back onto GitHub.

This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2019-20.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

Looking at the screen for more than 1.5 hours is hurting my eyes.
the push part is challenging, for we have to use a token rather than the code, but no one telled us.
the way to get out the vim is not right too.
I finally used git revert --no-commit HEAD
